After having prepared a package for patching with [`bun patch`](/docs/cli/patch), you can install with `bun patch-commit <temp-directory_path>`.

### `--patches-dir`

By default, `bun patch-commit` will use the `patches` directory in the temporary directory.

You can specify a different directory with the `--patches-dir` flag.
